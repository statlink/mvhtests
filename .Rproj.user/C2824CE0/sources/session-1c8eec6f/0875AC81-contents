\description{

\usage{
james.hotel(x1, x2)

}
\item{x2}{
A matrix containing the Euclidean data of the second group.
}
}

\details{
Emerson (2009, pg. 76--81) mentioned a very nice result between the Hotelling's one sample \eqn{T^2} and James test for two mean vectors
\deqn{
J\left(\pmb{\mu}\right) = T_1^2\left(\pmb{\mu}\right) + T_2^2\left(\pmb{\mu}\right),
}
where \eqn{J\left(\pmb{\mu}\right)} is the James test statistic (James, 1954) and \eqn{T_1^2\left(\pmb{\mu}\right)} and \eqn{T_1^2\left(\pmb{\mu}\right)} are the two one sample Hotelling's {\eqnT^2} test statistic values (see function \code{\link{hotel1T2}) for each sample from their common mean vector \eqn{\pmb{\mu}_c} (see the help file of \code{\link{james}}). In fact, James test statistic is found from minimizing the right hand side of the above expression with respect to \eqn{\pmb{\mu}}. The sum is mimized when \eqn{\pmb{\mu}} takes the form of the common mean vector \eqn{\pmb{\mu}_c}. The same is true for the t-test in the univariate case.

I have created this function illustrating this result, so this one is for educational purposes. It calculates the James test statistic, the sum of the two \eqn{T^2} test statistics, the common mean vector and the one found via numerical optimization. In the univariate case, the common mean vector is a weighted linear combination of the two sample means. So, if we take a segment connecting the two means, the common mean is somewhere on that segment. This is not true however for the multivariate case.
