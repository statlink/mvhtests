\description{
MMPC and the FBED variable selection algorithms using the distance correlation.
}

\usage{
dcor.mmpc(y, x, max_k = 3, alpha = 0.05, B = 999, backward = TRUE)
dcor.fbed(y, x, alpha = 0.05, K = 0, backward = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
\item{y}{
A numerical vector with the response variable.
}
\item{x}{
A numerical matrix with the predictor variables.
}
\item{max_k}{
The maximum conditioning set to use in the conditional indepedence test (see Details).
Integer, default value is 3.
}
\item{alpha}{
The significance level for assessing the p-values. Default value is 0.05.
}
\item{B}{
The number of permutations to execute to compute the p-value of the distance correlation.
}
\item{backward}{
Should the backward selection take place? The default value is set to TRUE.
}
}

\details{
The max_k option: the maximum size of the conditioning set to use in the conditioning independence test.
Larger values provide more accurate results, at the cost of higher computational times. When the sample
size is small (e.g., \eqn{<50} observations) the max_k parameter should be 3 for example, otherwise the
conditional independence test may not be able to provide reliable results.

Both the MMPC (Tsamardinos, Aliferis and Statnikov, 2003) and FBED algortihms (Borboudakis and Tsamardinos, 2019) are performed though by utilizing the distance correlation (Szekely et al., 2007, Szekely and Rizzo 2014, Huo and Szekely, 2016).

\value{
A list including:
\item{runtime}{
The duration of the algorithm.
}
\item{res}{
A matrix with the selected variables and their corresponding (logarithm) of the p-values of the updated associations. For the mmpc algorithm, the final p-value is the maximum p-value among the two p-values in the end.
